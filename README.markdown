# jQuery UI WebTour Widget

The Webtour is a jQuery UI Widget that is designed to make it easy to add an interactive tour to your website pages. The interactive nature of the webtour improves user engagement and results in greater understanding by your users. These tours are showing up in more and more websites and range from very simple to very complex.

The webtour uses the jQuery UI dialog and position APIs to allow you to control the appearance and placement of each step in your tour. The webtour exposes a number of options and events that you can use to customize the tour for your site.
